        At least 1.5 million disposable cups are generated on UBC campus annually, and less than 50% are sorted into proper waste bins.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Mug-Share program has been developed by AMS sustainability in collaboration with SEEDS to promote sustainable practices through the use of reusable mugs instead of paper cups.
        The goal of the project is to implement a campus wide mug sharing system in the hopes to encourage students and staff to make more sustainable choices.
        <br />
        <br />
        This machine helps achieve this goal by automating the dispensing of mugs, creating a more convenient experience for the user, and allowing for future program expansion on campus.
        <br />
        <br />
        Once you are registered with the Mug-Share program, simply swipe your UBC card to receive a mug and head on over to Uppercase for some coffee! Then when you’re finished, just return the mug to UpperCase or the SLSC on the lower floor of the Nest.
